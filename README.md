# pygame-checkers
This is a peer-to-peer local networked game of checkers that I built with Python and pygame.

DISCLAIMER: Although I was able to get multiplayer support working through localhost, I was unable to
play a game using my actual IPv4. I don't know if this was a firewall issue or (more likely) that my code is
faulty. I can, however, guarantee that the local modes work as intended. If you see issues with my code or have
some suggestions, please feel free to email me at ebrown5676@gmail.com.
