# pygame-checkers
This is a peer-to-peer local networked game of checkers that I built with Python and pygame.

Although I was able to get multiplayer support working through localhost, I was unable to
play a game using my actual IPv4. I don't know if this was a firewall issue or there is a fault in the codebase.
I can, however, guarantee that the local modes work as intended.
